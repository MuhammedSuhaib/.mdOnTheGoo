# Headings

There are two ways to create headings:

1. Using `#` followed by a space  
2. Using `=` (equals) and `-` (hyphens) on the next line  

The `=` and `-` method only supports **two heading levels**.  
Always include **blank lines before and after headings** for better compatibility.

## Headings with `#`
# 1  
## 2  
### 3  
#### 4  
##### 5  
###### 6  

## Headings with `=` and `-`
Heading 1  
=  

Heading 2  
-  

# Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, no special symbol is required ‚Äî just use a **blank line** to separate them.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs unless inside a list.

# Line Breaks

To create a line break, use one of these:

| Method                | Status           | Notes                                  |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `<br>`               | ‚úÖ Recommended   | Clear and visible                      |
| Two or more spaces   | ‚úÖ Best Practice | Works widely, but hard to see in code  |
| Backslash `\`        | ‚ùå Not Reliable  | Not widely supported                   |
| Just Enter/Return    | ‚ùå Not Reliable  | Depends on renderer                    |


# Spaces

Use &nbsp; to add a single space between words or elements.

Or 

You can use `<pre>` to display all spaces & blanks you have typed. E.g.:

<pre>
Hi,   I  am  using             a lot
   of  spaces     here   

      ....
</pre>


---

# Horizontal Rule (HR)

Create a horizontal rule with **3 or more** asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a line alone.

Add blank lines **before and after** for best compatibility.

Examples:

```
***

---

___
```

---

# Emphasis

Use `*` or `_` to style text:

- *Italic*: `*text*` or `_text_`  
- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`  
- ***Bold Italic***: `***text***` or `___text___`
- <u>Underlined</u>: text is not supported. But you can use HTML `<u>` tag: `<u>text</u>`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~text~~`  
‚ö†Ô∏è Prefer `*` over `_` ‚Äî underscores can break mid-word.


# Lists

Use tabs for nested items. and **do not indent** the first item of a list. 
And to add elements like blockquotes or code blocks inside lists, indent them **four spaces** or **one tab**.

## Unordered Lists

Create unordered lists by starting each item with `*`, `-`, or `+` followed by a space. Use one symbol consistently.

## Ordered Lists

Create ordered lists by starting each item with `1.` followed by a space.

| Recommended | Not recommended |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| `1.`        | `1)`            |

If you want a list item starting with a number and period (not list numbering), escape the period with a backslash:

```markdown
- 1968\. A great year!
```

renders as:

* 1968\. A great year!

# Links 

1. **Basic Link**

```markdown
[Link Text](URL)
```

2. **Link with title (tooltip)**

```markdown
[Link Text](URL "Title")
```

3. **Auto-links for URLs or emails**

```markdown
<https://example.com>
<email@example.com>
```

4. **Formatting links**

* Bold: `**[text](URL)**`
* Italic: `*[text](URL)*`
* Code style: ``[`code`](URL)``

5. **Reference-style links** (split in two parts)

* Inline: `[text][label]` or `[text] [label]` (can work with a space or without a space both work)
* Definition (anywhere in file):

  ```markdown
  [label]: URL "Optional title"
  ```
* Example:

  ```markdown
  [hobbit-hole][1] when i click this it will take me where the 1 is defined
  ...
  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"
  ```

6. **Best Practices**

* Encode spaces as `%20` in URLs
* Encode parentheses as `%28` and `%29` or use HTML `<a>` tags
* Avoid spaces in URLs directly



# Images

* To add an image:

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url)
```

* To add a caption, put italic text **below** the image:

```markdown
![Trail](/path/image.jpg)  
*This is the caption.*
```

* To make the image a **link**, wrap the image Markdown in `[ ]` and add the link in `( )`:

```markdown
[![Alt text](image-url "Image title")](link-url)
```

Example:

```markdown
[![Rock](/rock.jpg "Rock photo")](https://example.com)
```

Done.

# Video

For embedding videos, you can use the following Markdown syntax. Replace `YOUTUBE-ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.
`[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE-ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE-ID)`

[!["This Is What 1 Pixel Actually Looks Like! (Mind-Blowing Experiment)"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kn1oT-VGxhI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kn1oT-VGxhI)

# Tables

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column‚Äôs header, and use pipes (|) to separate columns. For compatibility, add a pipe at both ends of the row.
You can align text left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or both sides of the hyphens in the header row.

‚ö†Ô∏è You can‚Äôt use headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules, images, or most HTML tags inside tables.
To display a pipe (|) in a table, use its HTML code (`&#124;`) because pipes are invisible in the rendered table.

```md
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |  <!-- To underline headings -->
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |  <!-- To align text -->
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |
```

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

You can add a list inside a table cell by using HTML tags, because directly adding list elements (`*`, `-`, `+`) won't work. Same for `<br>` tags.

## Table of Contents

```md
- [Horizontal Rule](index.md#horizontal-rule-hr)  
- [Images](index.md#images)  
- [Links](index.md#links)
```

* [Horizontal Rule](index.md#horizontal-rule-hr)
* [Images](index.md#images)
* [Links](index.md#links)



# Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add `>` before a paragraph.  
Include blank lines **before and after** for compatibility.

> 1 blockquote  
>> 2 blockquote  
>>> 3 blockquote  
>>>> 4 blockquote  
>>>>> 5 blockquote  
>>>>>> 6 blockquote  
>>>>>>> 7 blockquote  
>>>>>>>> 8 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>> 9 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>> 10 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>>> 11 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>>>> 12 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>>>>> 13 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 14 blockquote  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Most renderers support 10‚Äì15 levels  but vscode supports 100 levels.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 100ü§Ø
## Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can include other Markdown elements, but **not all will render properly**.  
Test as needed.

# Comments

Here's a paragraph that will be visible.

[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # 

And here's another paragraph that's visible.

# Symbols
Not supported by Markdown, but you can use HTML entities to display special characters or symbols.

Here‚Äôs a partial list of HTML entities for symbols:

Copyright (¬©) ‚Äî &copy;
Registered trademark (¬Æ) ‚Äî &reg;
Trademark (‚Ñ¢) ‚Äî &trade;
Euro (‚Ç¨) ‚Äî &euro;
Left arrow (‚Üê) ‚Äî &larr;
Up arrow (‚Üë) ‚Äî &uarr;
Right arrow (‚Üí) ‚Äî &rarr;
Down arrow (‚Üì) ‚Äî &darr;
Degree (¬∞) ‚Äî &#176;
Pi (œÄ) ‚Äî &#960;

# Code Blocks

Create code blocks using three backticks (\`\`\`).
If your code contains backticks, use double backticks for the fence:

Example:

```markdown
``Use `code` in code block.``
```

# Escaping Characters

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
The rendered output looks like this:

* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

Characters You Can Escape
You can use a backslash to escape the following characters.
```
Character	Name
\	backslash
`	backtick (see also escaping backticks in code)
*	asterisk
_	underscore
{ }	curly braces
[ ]	brackets
< >	angle brackets
( )	parentheses
#	hash sign
+	plus sign
-	minus sign (hyphen)
.	dot
!	exclamation mark
|	pipe (see also escaping pipe in tables)

```
# HTML
For security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check your Markdown application‚Äôs documentation. Some applications support only a subset of HTML tags.

Use blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, and `<p>` from the surrounding content. Try not to indent the tags with tabs or spaces ‚Äî that can interfere with the formatting.

You can‚Äôt use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example, <p>italic and **bold**</p> won‚Äôt work.

## ‚úÖ Extended Syntax (Working on GitHub)

These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. Not all Markdown applications support these elements.

### Table

* [Click here for Tables](tables.md#tables)

### Fenced Code Block (Language-specific code block)

Code blocks with syntax highlighting can be done using either backticks or tildes.
Backticks are more common and recommended.

```py
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

### Footnote (not supported in VS Code)

Footnotes create a reference link that takes you to a note at the bottom of the page, like this:

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

You don‚Äôt have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, blockquotes, and tables.

### Strikethrough

~~Just need two tildes.~~
VS Code supports it but sometimes behaves oddly.

### Task List (not supported in VS Code)

* [x] Write the press release
* [ ] Update the website
* [ ] Contact the media

### Emoji (not supported in VS Code)

That is so funny! \:joy:


## ‚ùå Extended Syntax NOT Working on GitHub and VS Code

### Highlight

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.
ALT:
I need to highlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.

### Subscript

H~~2~~O
ALT: H<sub>2</sub>O

### Superscript

X^2^
ALT: X<sup>2</sup>

### Heading ID

### My Great Heading {#custom-id}

You can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a standard link with a number sign (#) followed by the custom heading ID. These are commonly referred to as anchor links.

`[Heading IDs](#custom-id)` [Heading IDs](#custom-id)
Other websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g., [Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)).

### Definition List

Here I don‚Äôt need to style what is a term and what is a definition; it will be rendered as a definition list automatically.

term
: definition

## ‚ö† Works but Deprecated

### Center

Markdown has no direct way to center text, but HTML can be used:

```html
<center>This text is centered.</center>
```

<center>This text is centered.</center>

### Color

```html
<font color="red">This text is red!</font>
```

<font color="red">This text is red!</font>
